            "description": "On June 2, Volexity reported during an incident response investigation that occured over Memorial day weekend. They identified suspicious activity on two, Internet-facing, servers running Atlassian’s Confluence Server application. After analysis of the compromise, Volexity determined the initial foothold was the result of an exploit that led to remote code execution on the Confluence servers. The details were reported to Atlassion on May 31, and Atlassian has since assigned the issue to CVE-2022-26134.\n\nBased on the security advisory issued by Atlassian, it appears that the exploit is indeed an unauthenticated, remote code execution vulnerability. \n enter a description for this ATOM (markdown supported)",
