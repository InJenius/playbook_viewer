The criminal group behind IcedID also acts as an initial access broker for other criminal groups.\n\nIn an Active Directory (AD) environment, IcedID infections lead to network mapping, with criminals using tools like ADfind.exe, an AD enumeration utility [2]. Criminals use access from IcedID to collect information about AD users, systems, organizational units, subnets, groups, and trust objects.\n\nIn recent years, IcedID routinely has routinely led to Cobalt Strike and lateral movement within a targeted AD network. Cobalt strike is a known precursor to ransomware like Conti [3].\n\nIcedID is distributed through different campaigns run by different threat actors, but the end result is the same. Regardless of the distribution channel, IcedID causes remote access, data exfiltration, and follow-up activity like Cobalt Strike and ransomware.\n\n[1] https://securityintelligence.com/new-banking-trojan-icedid-discovered-by-ibm-x-force-research/\n[2] https://thedfirreport.com/2021/06/20/from-word-to-lateral-movement-in-1-hour/\n[3] https://thedfirreport.com/2022/04/04/stolen-images-campaign-ends-in-conti-ransomware/",

            "description": "Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.\n\nThere are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.
